# Ts-vite-googleMaps

## Description
This project is a refactorization of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Google Maps application demo from his "Understanding TypeScript" Udemy course. Originally a vanilla Ts app, I rewrote this app in vite-react and by expressing the API keys as env variables, I could then ensure that these env variables were not exposed in the browser.
